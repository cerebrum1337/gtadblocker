***How to use/install***
Download release here
Replace existing SecureEngineSDK64.dll in Growtopia directory with the downloaded one
Done
Features
Disables airplanes and billboards in the default sunny weather background in all worlds
Hide ads in actual ad blocks (todo)
Notes
SecureEngineSDK64 is an unused dll that does not do anything anymore, containing only empty functions. By naming our dll as this, gt will load it automatically at startup.
This ad blocker is essentially a very tiny internal cheat. It is compatible with other internal cheats, because it does not hook anything.
